# Number_Guesser.Js
This is a simple number guessing game coded in JavaScript.

A user will predict a number which must be close enough to the target number generated randomly by the program in order to win.

By default, the program will only allow users to predict numbers from 1 to 9.

After every guess or prediction, the program displays a target number and notifies user about the winner.

Users play with the computer, and so the program is able to compare the guesses of both the computer and the user.

If the computer's guess is closer to the target than the user's guess, the Computer wins, else, user wins.


To use:
